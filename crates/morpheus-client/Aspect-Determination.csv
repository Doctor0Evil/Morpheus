"Aspect","Determination"
"Jurisdiction-Crossing","Validates FPIC + EcoAdmissible + RoH monotonicity; allows crossing only if all predicates true"
"Microspace Protection","Computes organism-specific density/activity/duration ceilings; blocks swarm if any exceeded"
"Host-Locality Binding","Enforces geographic + temporal fences; revokes if swarm attempts unauthorized approach"
"Organic Integration","Ensures swarms don't displace/harm resident organisms; triggers retreat on stress markers"
"Free-Roaming Bounds","Allows motion within approved corridors + authorized crossings; denies off-map or FPIC-denied regions"
"Audit Trail","Logs every decision to EvolutionAuditRecord (DID-bound, immutable)"
"RoH/BCI Monotonicity","Ensures no swarm activity increases biocompatibility risk or violates rights-of-humanity floor"
"Emergent Safety","Computes E_comp (composite margin) to detect macro-scale interference before it harms"
